# SmartThings Pool Controller

This is my first device handler for SmartThings

I wanted to create a pool controller for swiching modes in our pool and will eventually add the vacuum and other items in later. Hopefully this will either help someone along that is looking to do similiar or give you just what you need.

Right now I do not have any valves I'm running the testing of a bread board and lighting up some LEDs. This is working great and the goolge assistant integration through IFTTT is a nice have.

This project requires stretch OS on Raspberry Pi.
WEBIOPI setup on the RPi.
